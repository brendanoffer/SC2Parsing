### SC2Parser

This parser gets the first 10 buildings created by each player and converts it to CSV format for easy data analysis.

This runs on top of the Python SC2Reader located here: https://github.com/GraylinKim/sc2reader

These two scripts just filter the data into something more adaptable for analysis.
